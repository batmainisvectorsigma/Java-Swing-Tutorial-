# Java Swing Tutorial

Here I am uploading programs from a book that I have read. The motive of this repo is to help people not spend a lot more time reading book and could just jump into swing programming.

# from where to start reading this repo
- you can start reading from NotHelloWorld.java file. This NotHelloWorld.java file is not in a any folder. So, you can start from a file that is not in nay folder just like NotHelloWorld.java file.

- After reading all the file that is not in a certain folder. You can start reading file is inside a folder. That is you can start from Action, Border, ComboBoxes, DialogBoxes, Event, JButton, Layout Manangement, Menu, Mouse, Sliders, TextFiel, Troubleshoot GUI Programs etc. 

# Conclusion
After reading this repo you can start creating applications. Just reading this repo and not making anything after reading is similar to a person who doesn't read anything.
